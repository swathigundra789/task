<h2>about visual studiocode</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code is the most popular code editor and the IDEs provided by Microsoft for writing different programs and languages. It allows the users to develop new code bases for their applications and allow them to successfully optimize them.
 For its high popularity, individuals opt to Install Visual Studio Code on Windows over any other IDE. Installation of Windows Visual Studio Code is not a difficult matter. The Installation process starts with Downloading the Visual Studio Code EXE file to some on-screen instructions.</p>
<h2>key features</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h3>command line</h3></h2></li>
    <p>Visual Studio Code has a powerful command line interface that lets you control how you launch the editor. You can open different files, install extensions, and even change the display language at the startup.</p>
    <li><h3>command palette</h3></li>
    <p>VS Code is equally accessible from the keyboard. The most important key combination to know is Ctrl+Shift+P, which brings up the Command Palette. From here, you would have access to all of the functionality of VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations.</p>
    <li><h3>git integration</h3></li>
    <p>Visual Studio Code comes with Git integration that allows you to commit, pull, and push your code changes to a remote Git repository.</p>
    <li><h3>change language mode</h3></li>
    <p>If you want to persist the new language mode for that file type, you can use the Configure File Association for command to associate the current file extension with an installed language.

        <pre></pre>Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+K M</p>
        <li><h3>zen mode</h3></li>
        <p>Zen Mode lets you focus on your code by hiding all UI except the editor (no Activity Bar, Status Bar, Side Bar and Panel), going to full screen and centering the editor layout. Zen mode can be toggled using the View menu, Command Palette, or by the shortcut Ctrl+K Z. Double Esc exits Zen Mode.</p>
        <li><h3>split view</h3></li>
        <p>If you’re good at multitasking and if you are working on two different files of the same project simultaneously, or need to check the difference between two files then go to the split view.</p>
        <li><h3>debugging</h3></li>
        <p>Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select Debug: Open launch.json, which will prompt you to select the environment that matches your project (Node.JS, Python, C++, etc). This will generate a launch.json file. Node.JS support is built-in and other environments require installing the appropriate language extensions. See the debugging documentation for more details.</p>
        </ol>
        <h1>extensions in vs code </h1>
        <p>Software development or web development is a field where every developer is searching for some tools, technology, or Visual Studio Code Extensions that can be helpful in boosting their productivity. Different programmers have different choices and they use different approaches. For developers sometimes it becomes quite frustrating to write the same code at multiple places, refreshing the page or doing formatting in code so many times</p>

                <td>Generally, when we make any change in our code, to see those changes on the browser we need to manually refresh the page to see the changes happening. Here the live server extension comes into the picture. After it has been installed, an automated localhost will be able to run in your browser, which you can start with a single button. Once you makechanges in your code or write something new, after saving it, the browser will auto-refresh itself, then you will be able to see the changes quickly and automatically. The live server enables you to open an HTML document, and it runs a server for you and opens a browser window with the file in it. </td>

                    This extension is most useful for projects where a server is not already created (e.g. not for apps using React, Angular, etc.). To work with these, feel free to run the Simple Browser: Show command that is already built-in with VS Code.</td>

Emmet prevents you from writing the entire code by yourself by providing Emmet abbreviation. Emmet is enabled by default in html, haml, pug, slim, jsx, xml, xsl, css, scss, sass, less and stylus files, and also in languages that inherits from any of the above like handlebars and PHP.</td>
