            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Front-end Development is the development or creation of a user interface using some markup languages and other tools. It is the development of the user side where only user interaction will be counted. It consists of the interface where buttons, texts, alignments, etc are involved and used by the user.
                Front-end is the part that is accessible to the user only, It should be self-explanatory and must be user-friendly and designed. so to achieve this we have some basic languages which can be used to create interactive web pages. These are the basic needs for the creation of a web page.
                Frameworks add more features to their respective languages. Frameworks provide extra features, structure, fast reloading, and many more things so that developers can develop a SPA(Single page application) easily. Some of them provide inbuilt functions or pre-defined components so that developer can directly use those in their projects.

            <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the modern standard for displaying and structuring web content across the internet.[6] HTML defines what elements will be displayed on a website, and how they will be arranged. All major web browsers are designed to interpret HTML, and most modern websites serve HTML to the user.[7] Hypertext is text displayed on a computer with references to other text, these references (or links,) are termed "hyperlinks." When an internet user interacts with a hyperlinked item, the website serves the user the linked data. This data can be another HTML web-page, JavaScript, or anything else. The latest major release of HTML is HTML5, originally published on October 28, 2014 as a W3C recommendation.[8][9]
         A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.
The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.
You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
