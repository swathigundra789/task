        <summary>PANEER TIKKA</summary>
    <p>Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori starter and snack where Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated in a spiced yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven. Worry not if you don’t have an oven – instead of grilling in oven, you can make Tandoori Paneer Tikka Recipe on stovetop on a tawa/skillet. In this post I am sharing both the oven and stovetop methods.

        <summary>DAL MAKHANI</summary>
        <P>There are some dishes that represent Punjabi cuisine, like none other. Dal Makhani is one of them. It is one of the most popular lentil recipes from North Indian Punjabi cuisine and is made with whole black lentils (urad dal or kali dal in Hindi) and kidney beans (rajma in Hindi). This Dal Makhani Recipe is a restaurant style version with subtle smoky flavors and creaminess of the lentils. If you are a fan of North Indian food and those lovely Punjabi flavors in your food, then you are going to love this makhani dal even more.

        <summary>FRENCH FRIES</summary>
        <p>French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. They are often salted and may be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other sauces. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine, loaded fries or chili cheese fries. French fries can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant, oven fries, uses less or no oil.[4]

        <summary>CHICKEN 65</summary> 
        <p>Chicken 65 is a spicy, deep-fried chicken dish originating from Hotel Buhari,[1] Chennai,[2] India, as an entrée, or quick snack. The flavour of the dish can be attributed to red chillies, but the exact set of ingredients for the recipe can vary. It is prepared using boneless chicken and is usually served with an onion and lemon garnish. Vegetarian variants like "Paneer 65" or "Gobi 65" use paneer or cauliflower instead. While the name "Chicken 65" is universally used to refer to the dish, there are many different theories claiming its origins.
